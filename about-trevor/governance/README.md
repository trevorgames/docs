# Governance

## **Process**

1. Submit Trevor DAO Improvement Proposals (TIP) through our Trevor DAO forum to assess interest and initiate constructive conversations â€” discussions that can be extended in our newly established dedicated Discord channels for "TIPs" and "Governance."
2. Upon reaching quorum and ensuring substantial engagement, proceed to the formal voting phase, wherein proposals will be ratified for implementation by the DAO.

## Eligible voters

Voting rights are extended exclusively to $TRV stakers (including Harvesters and Governance Staking) and individuals holding $TRV-WETH SLP in the Celestia LP Rewards contract. Only those with $gTRV are permitted to participate in the voting process.

## gTRV

Governance $TRV (or "gTRV") introduces concepts from the veCRV model, aligning governance rights with community members committed to the long-term success of the DAO. Therefore:

* Only staked $TRV (veTRV) or $TRV-WETH SLP within the Celestia LP Rewards contract will be considered for voting. Liquid $TRV (e.g., unstaked or uncommitted $TRV) will **NOT** contribute to governance.
* gTRV derived from Harvesters is calculated on a 1:1 basis for TRV staked.
* gTRV derived from Governance Staking is calculated on a 1:1 basis for TRV staked.

gTRAGIC automatically adjusts for new positions in the Harvesters, SLP rewards, and Governance Staking contract.

## Voting

Voting will be based on your gTRV holdings on Celestia only.&#x20;

If you're already staked in the Harvesters, Governance Staking, or you have SLP within the LP Rewards contract, you do **NOT** need to do anything.&#x20;

To participate in voting, you'll need to connect your wallet to our voting page (to be shared at a later date), and your gTRV holdings will automatically appear. You must be connected to the Celestia network.&#x20;

The TIP will be ratified when quorum is reached with a greater than or equal to 75% vote 'for' in the vote.

&#x20;We look forward to building Trevor together with the community!
