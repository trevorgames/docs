## Why Trevor?

Trevor is not just a platform; it's a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the way we experience, create, and share games.

1. **Fully Onchain Integration:** MUD, which is a framework designed for ambitious Ethereum applications, makes it possible for the entire application state, from complex game logic to user interactions, resides entirely on the EVM. Trevor harnesses the power of MUD to the extent that game governance, e.g. listing/delisting, and interactions between games are also fully onchain!
2. **Decentralized Economy:** Trevor embraces decentralization, allowing players to truly own their in-game assets. Whether it's rare items, unique characters, or valuable resources, the Trevor platform ensures that your virtual possessions are securely stored on the blockchain, giving you true ownership and control.
3. **Community-Driven Development:** We believe in the wisdom of the crowd. Trevor fosters a vibrant and engaged community where players and developers collaborate to shape the future of gaming. Have a say in the games you love, and witness the magic of community-driven development.
4. **Blockchain Rewards:** Trevor rewards active participants in the ecosystem. Whether you're a skilled player, a creative developer, or a dedicated contributor, our platform recognizes and rewards your efforts with blockchain-based incentives, creating a fair and inclusive gaming economy.

The future of gaming is fully onchain, and Trevor is your gateway to this revolutionary frontier.
