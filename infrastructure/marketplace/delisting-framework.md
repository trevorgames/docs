# Delisting Framework

As we acknowledge that norms and community expectations are continually evolving, it is crucial that Trevor maintains stringent guidelines for both collections and items to uphold the safety and reputation of the marketplace.

A collection or item may be delisted on Trevor if it is determined to:

* Infringe on protected intellectual property.
* Promote suicide or self-harm.
* Incite hate or violence against others.
* Degrade or dox another individual.
* Be a blatant copy of existing projects (excluding derivatives or extensions).

As Trevor explores the potential transition to an open listings model and a permissionless structure, changes to our operational approach may be necessary. Consequently, we commit to listening to our community, aligning with our evolving business strategy, and adjusting these guidelines accordingly.
