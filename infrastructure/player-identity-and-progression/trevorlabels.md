## What is a TrevorLabel?

A TrevorLabel is a free gamertag that serves as your global player profile and identity within the Trevor gaming ecosystem. It acts as the foundation for your user reputation across various Trevor experiences. This Label is a "soulbound" digital collectible, meaning it is non-transferrable and uniquely tied to you. Possessing a Label will be a requirement for participation in upcoming product releases, including the future Proof of Play meta games, and other exclusive experiences accessible only to Label holders.

In the long term, your TrevorLabel can be linked to avatars, allowing you to enhance your social identity. You can also earn badges to showcase your achievements and benefit from cosmetic modifiers to customize the appearance of your Label and make it stand out.

The TrevorLabel onsists of two parts: a name and a discriminant (a 4-digit ending). Players are limited to one Label per wallet.
