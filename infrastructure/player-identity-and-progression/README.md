# Player Identity & Progression

Trevor's player identity and progression framework are fueled by TrevorLabels and complemented by our Badges & Achievements system.&#x20;

Together, these constitute powerful tools that empower players to construct their on-chain reputation within the Trevor ecosystem of games. Simultaneously, these tools offer game developers valuable insights into the behaviors and accomplishments of their players.
