# Tokenomics

TRV is the natural resource of the Trevor metaverse. It energizes NFTs, transforming them from mere fantasy into productive, yield-bearing assets.&#x20;

TRV is intentionally designed to become increasingly scarce, with emissions declining as the complexity of the economy grows. This scarcity is integral to weaving an ever-expanding web of narrative bridges within the Metaverse.

Players can earn $TRV through playing, mining, and participating in Trevor. As a result, the Trevor ecosystem is governed by $TRV holders.



The total $TRV supply will be 1 billion tokens with the following distribution:

* Team: 15%, of which 25% is initially unlocked and 75% is unlocked linearly over four years
* Early Backers: 15%, of which 25% is initially unlocked and 75% is unlocked linearly over four years
* Ecosystem Fund: 25%, fully unlocked, controlled by the Foundation/DAO
* Genesis Drop: 8%, fully unlocked distribution
* Future Initiatives: 12%, fully unlocked, Foundation/DAO controlled
* Staking & Mining: 25%, unlocked linearly over 12 years
