# Introduction

## $TRV



Every project featured on the Trevor platform incorporates $TRV in their respective metaverses, with each community crafting its own lore and storytelling for this resource. $TRV, the native token of Trevor, exclusively fuels marketplace transactions, serving as the reserve currency for the extensive network of metaverses interwoven beneath the Trevor umbrella.

The narrative and economic threads of Trevor projects are intertwined through $TRV. The DAO leverages $TRV emissions to nurture the development of new projects and sustain the growth of more established ones, reinforcing the vibrant connection within the Trevor ecosystem.

## DAO Governed

The TrevorDAO, governed by staked $TRV holders, takes charge of overseeing the project. Trevor's objective is to empower communities in bootstrapping new, decentralized metaverses. We firmly believe that metaverses are narratives crafted by communities, and resources serve as the threads weaving the fabric of the metaverse.

Decisions within the DAO encompass voting on projects to onboard, determining $TRV distribution, and establishing revenue-sharing agreements for the marketplace. The vision is for the DAO to foster a significantly larger ecosystem with a range of product offerings.

## Fully Onchain Integration

MUD, which is a framework designed for ambitious Ethereum applications, makes it possible for the entire application state, from complex game logic to user interactions, resides entirely on the EVM. Trevor harnesses the power of MUD to the extent that game governance, e.g. listing/delisting, and interactions/interoperates between games are also fully onchain.

Trevor embraces decentralization, allowing players to truly own their in-game assets. Whether it's rare items, unique characters, or valuable resources, the Trevor platform ensures that your virtual possessions are securely stored on the blockchain, giving you true ownership and control.

## Community-Driven Development

We believe in the wisdom of the crowd. Trevor fosters a vibrant and engaged community where players and developers collaborate to shape the future of gaming. Have a say in the games you love, and witness the magic of community-driven development.

Trevor rewards active participants in the ecosystem. Whether you're a skilled player, a creative developer, or a dedicated contributor, our platform recognizes and rewards your efforts with blockchain-based incentives, creating a fair and inclusive gaming economy.

The future of gaming is fully onchain, and Trevor is your gateway to this revolutionary frontier.
