# Liquidity Mining

To facilitate the swift exchange of digital assets on the platform, Trevor will initially launch two liquidity pools: TRV/USDC and TRV/ETH. This will allow platform users to easily exchange assets. Additionally, users will have the option to contribute liquidity to these pools and earn rewards through liquidity mining.
